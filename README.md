This project demonstrates an **automation flow between OnceHub, Zapier, Keap (formerly Infusionsoft), and Teachworks** to streamline scheduling, CRM management, and education management.  
It captures **OnceHub booking events**, passes them through **Zapier Zaps**, and syncs customer/student data into **Keap CRM** for tagging and automation. The data is then pushed to **Teachworks** to manage classes, enrollments, and lesson tracking.
